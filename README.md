# Data Analyst Portfolio
The repository contains data processed by me in the form of Jupyter Notebook, which I performed for academic purposes, self-development and for my own acquaintance.

# Machine learning

## Regression
- [HousePrice](https://github.com/antonshuliak/DS-Portfolio/blob/master/Price.ipynb): selection and creation of new features, data transformation, selection of regression model parameters. Creating an average regression model to calculate the price of the house.
## Classification
- [Deposit](https://github.com/antonshuliak/DS-Portfolio/blob/master/Deposit.ipynb): building a model for classifying customers by the presence or absence of deposits.
## Clustering

# Neural networks

# Data analysis (EDA)

- [BankCustomers](https://github.com/antonshuliak/DS-Portfolio/blob/master/CardCustomer.ipynb): analysis of the bank's customers and construction of simple models to assess whether the customer uses the card
- [Football Leagues](https://github.com/antonshuliak/DS-Portfolio/blob/master/Football.ipynb): analysis of statistics of the best football leagues. Comparison of differences between 2018 and 2019. Search for players with the best statistics.
- [Traffic](https://github.com/antonshuliak/DS-Portfolio/blob/master/Traffic.ipynb): Analysis of the dependence of traffic on the amount of advertising, the dollar exchange rate and the average salary.

## Statistical analysis
- [ABtest](https://github.com/antonshuliak/DS-Portfolio/blob/master/ABtest.ipynb): comparison of the impact of different types of screensavers on player retention.

## Time series analysis
